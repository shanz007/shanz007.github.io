Following are some of the Home UI screens of the system.\nKey Features # User Guidance Support pages – Provides the functional workflow, research and other related user study details such as purpose, data privacy and consent policies etc.\nRegistration \u0026amp; User Sign-in/out pages – Supports user session, personalization and activity tracking with minimal data retention. Profile Data Retrieval – Accept a Twitter handle (e.g., @username) and fetch publicly available profile data, including credibility-related attributes. Profile Verification – Review and confirm the retrieved data or flag any discrepancies, ensuring transparency before AI analysis. AI-Powered Recommendations – The system leverages LLMs to generate tailored suggestions across three categories: Profile Overview, Visual Elements, and Engagement \u0026amp; Activity. User Feedback \u0026amp; Action – Users can rate the usefulness of recommendations and selectively apply changes to improve profile credibility. Research Purpose # The primary research goal was to investigate:\nHow Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), and Behavioral Intention (BI) affect user trust in AI-driven recommendations. How credibility cues in social media profiles can be made more transparent and actionable with AI assistance. How TAM3 (Technology Acceptance Model 3) applies to evaluating modern AI-HCI systems. System Architecture # The TrustifyAI system was designed with a modular architecture to ensure usability, flexibility, and ease of development. Each component is separated by functionality to allow for clearer responsibility and independent upgrades. The overall architecture comprises four main layers\nFrontend: A Vue.js–based interface that supports profile input and user feedback. Backend: Node.js based RESTful API services for profile data retrieval, processing, and communication with other layers. Database: SQLite manages core user-level operations, including authentication credentials and session tracking. MongoDB stores participant feedback and interaction data. AI Layer: LLM integration for generating tailored recommendations Study Methodology # A user study was conducted to evaluate how participants engaged with the developed tool. The study was hosted on the research platform SONA, and complemented with Google Forms surveys. Collected data was analyzed in a structured manner.\nPre-Study Survey: Captured demographics, Twitter usage, and expectations of users The figure above shows participants’ comparative familiarity with Twitter features and AI/LLMs. The figure above illustrates overall user appreciation for the AI-generated recommendations.\nabove shows the concentration of Likert-scale responses (1 to 5) across three evaluation components: Profile Overview, Visual Elements, and Engagement \u0026amp; Activity\nThink-Aloud Sessions: Observed and recorded participants interaction while using the system Post-Study Survey: Evaluated the collected data for usability, trust, and many other adoption metrics. In-App Feedback: Gathered real-time user comments, and feedback directly within the system. Ovrall Analysis # High usability scores – participants found the interface intuitive Recommendations rated as relevant and actionable Trust emerged not just as an outcome but as a distinct construct Qualitative feedback showed: Encouraged self-reflection on online credibility Increased awareness of digital identity cues Desire for personalization, transparency, and platform flexibility Perceived Role in Reducing Misinformation # Participants saw TrustifyAI as a helpful tool for promoting more credible and transparent online identities. By encouraging clearer, verifiable profile information, it supported authenticity and accountability on social media. While its direct effect on systemic misinformation was limited, users viewed it as a small but positive step toward a more trustworthy digital environment.\nLimitations and Challenges # Despite the promising outcomes, the project also revealed certain limitations that highlight opportunities for further improvement:\nRecommendations were sometimes generic due to limited personalization due to limited twitter content analysis, The tool’s Twitter-only focus restricted cross-platform credibility support. Lack of multimodal analysis (e.g., images) weakened identity representation. Evaluation was short-term and involved a small, homogeneous sample, limiting generalizability. Users expressed cautious trust in AI’s ethical judgment, highlighting a need for greater transparency and explainability. Overall Experience # Most participants found the tool intuitive, useful, and trustworthy. Guided by the TAM3 framework, results showed that ease of use and perceived usefulness strongly influenced trust and intention to adopt the tool. Users valued AI-generated feedback but also wanted more personalization and cross-platform functionality.\nFuture Work # Participants suggested expanding the tool’s scope and adaptability:\nSupport for other platforms (e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram) Personalized and multimodal feedback (more content, images, behavior) Long-term evaluation of sustained trust and adoption Inclusion of cross-cultural perspectives and larger, diverse user groups Technologies Used # Vue.js · Node.js · SQLite · MongoDB · Nginx · OpenAI\nConclusion # This study shows that TrustifyAI effectively encourages profile improvements while building user trust through clarity and usability. Users expressed both appreciation for its potential and healthy skepticism about AI’s broader role. To strengthen adoption, future systems should prioritize ethical design, transparency, adaptability, and cross-platform reach key to fostering credibility and trust in digital identities.\n","date":"30 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/academic/trustifyai/","section":"Projects: Academic Research / Industrial / Personal","summary":"","title":"TrustifyAI – AI-Powered Twitter/X Profile Credibility Evaluation","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"30 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/user-study/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"User Study","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"30 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/vue.js/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Vue.js","type":"tags"},{"content":" Project Overview # Research Unit: University of Oulu, UBICOMP\nTimeline: Nov 2024 – May 2025\nType: Academic Research / Progressive Web Software - A browser-based extension tool View app: SmartAdaptiveUi Smart Adaptive Interfaces is a research-driven browser extension that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically modify web content for improved digital wellbeing.\nThe project addresses the overuse of digital technologies by implementing three adaptive interaction modes that allow users to suppress, obscure, or highlight web elements based on AI-identified distractions and dark patterns. Our mixed-methods study with 18 participants demonstrated that users preferred the suppress mode and valued the ability to toggle between modes, enhancing their sense of control over digital distractions.\nThis project began as a developing a prototype to explore how AI can improve users\u0026rsquo; digital lives by creating a functional system evaluated through a user study. The project was selected at Academic MindTrek 2025 in Tampere, Finland, recognizing its contribution to intelligent, adaptive Digital Self-Control Tools (DSCTs). Key Features # Suppress (Delete Mode) – Removes distractions or irrelevant elements for a clean, minimal focused browsing experience. Obscure Mode (Blur Mode) – Obscures distracting elements while maintaining page layout and context. Highlight Mode (Box Mode) – Visually emphasizes distractions using bounding boxes for attention management. Dynamic Toggling – Seamless switching between modes during browsing sessions. Research Purpose # The primary research goal was to investigate:\nHow AI-driven content modification influences user focus, productivity, and cognitive load across different website types. How real-time LLM processing can be effectively integrated into browser environments for immediate user benefit. How users navigate and prefer between different levels of content intervention (removal, obscuring, highlighting) based on context and task requirements. System Architecture # The SmartAdaptiveUI browser extension is implemented with React and JavaScript ES6 modules, built on the Chrome Extensions API and OpenAI API. Its modular design separates functionality across three layers:\nPopup UI – main interface to facilitate interactions between the user interface and web pages and providing the functionalities.\nBackground logic – manages API calls, processes user actions, and coordinates extension events.\nContent scripts (DOM interaction layer)- – dynamically filter, modify, or highlight webpage elements based on AI outputs.\nThe system communicates directly with OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 for content analysis and intervention decisions, eliminating the need for a dedicated backend server. This reduces latency, simplifies deployment, and improves responsiveness.\nThe architecture (Figure 2) illustrates the flow between user interactions, the extension modules, and the LLM-powered adaptive interventions that enable Delete, Obscure, and Highlight modes.\nStudy Methodology # We conducted a mixed-methods user study with 18 participants (mean age = 26.4, SD = 4.2; 15 male, 3 female) recruited via our university’s SONA platform, and complemented with Google Forms surveys. Collected data was analyzed in a structured manner. After a pilot, the main study followed this flow:\nBaseline:- Participants first browsed unmodified websites (one self-chosen, two researcher-provided: clonezilla.org and bbc.com).\nPlugin interaction:- Each participant used the three modes — Delete, Blur, and Highlight/Box across three websites per mode (2 researcher-selected + 1 participant-selected), totaling 9 sessions.\nRandomization:- Mode order was balanced with a Latin Square design to minimize order effects.\nEvaluation:- After each mode, participants completed the UEQ-L (User Experience Questionnaire, long version), capturing both pragmatic (clarity, efficiency) and hedonic (stimulation, originality) qualities.\nWrap-up:- A final questionnaire and think-aloud interviews captured overall impressions and behavioral observations while the system being used. Ovrall Analysis # Quantitative: Kruskal–Wallis tests showed significant differences between modes (p \u0026lt; 0.05). Delete mode scored highest in user experience.\nQualitative:\nSuppress/Delete → most effective for removing distractions and enhancing focus. Obscure/Blur → useful, but sometimes hid relevant content and created clutter. Highlight/Box → mixed reactions; helpful for marking ads but occasionally flagged irrelevant items. Toggling features were highly valued, giving users flexible, real-time control. Emerging themes highlighted the need for customizable filtering, transparency in AI decisions, and context-aware interventions that adapt to specific tasks and sites. Participants emphasized that real-time control supported greater focus and mindful browsing.\nLimitations and Challenges # Our study faced several limitations. The sample size was small (n=18) and skewed toward digitally literate university students, which may reduce generalizability. The controlled environment may not fully reflect natural browsing behaviors. Technical constraints included OpenAI token limits restricting page content size, difficulties with infinite scroll and dynamic loading, and limited adaptability for non-English sites. Interaction times were also short, leaving longer-term use effects unexplored.\nKey challenges arose in ensuring real-time adaptability across diverse website structures. Mapping distractions and dark patterns without breaking site functionality was complex, often leading to false positives. Minor bugs and DOM inconsistencies highlighted the need for continued refinement.\nFuture Work # Future work will explore:\nPersonalization of distraction filtering and adaptive interventions. Support for multilingual and non-English sites to increase accessibility. Extended longitudinal studies to capture long-term effects, user fatigue, and sustained behavior change. Improved technical resilience, including handling infinite scroll, complex DOMs, and reducing false positives. Academic Contribution # This work advances research on Digital Self-Control Tools (DSCTs) by introducing an AI-powered, adaptive browser extension that moves beyond static blocking. Our contribution lies in:\nDemonstrating three distinct interaction modes (Delete, Blur, Highlight/Box) for user-driven customization. Integrating LLM-based detection with real-time, user-controlled interventions. Providing empirical evidence from a mixed-methods user study on how adaptive interfaces affect perceived control, usability, and digital well-being. Technologies Used # React · JavaScript (ES6 Modules) · Chrome Extensions API · OpenAI (GPT-3.5) · Content Scripts / DOM Manipulation · HTML5 · CSS3\nConclusion # Smart Adaptive Interfaces demonstrate how LLM-powered adaptive tools can give users granular control over web distractions in real time. While Delete mode emerged as the most effective, all modes highlighted trade-offs between clarity, flexibility, and usability. Despite technical and methodological limitations, the study shows the potential of adaptive AI systems to enhance focus, self-regulation, and mindful browsing. This prototype paves the way for personalized, context-aware DSCTs that can scale beyond controlled settings and into everyday digital life.\n","date":"15 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/academic/smartadaptiveinterfaces/","section":"Projects: Academic Research / Industrial / Personal","summary":"","title":"Smart Adaptive Interfaces – AI-Powered Digital Wellbeing","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"30 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/digital-identity/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Digital Identity","type":"tags"},{"content":" 💼 Work Experience # University Of Oulu, Finland Nov. 2024 - May 2025 Master\u0026#39;s Thesis Worker At UBCOMP ,I involved designing, deploying and evaluating TrustifyAI ,a custom-built PWA prototype powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to help users to improve their perceived credibility on social media profiles.
